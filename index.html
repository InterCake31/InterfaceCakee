                    <p class="testimony__verifiation"> <h4>Does the bot only buy or also sell the tokens?</h4></p>
                    
                    The bot only buys the tokens based on the input / amount you configure it to. It does not sell them. Selling will have to be done manually via PancakeSwap or Uniswap after around 5-10 minutes for the best profit.

                       </p>

                       <p class="testimony__verifiation"> <h4>Does it approve the token?</h4></p>
                    
                       
                       Approving a token is only needed when selling it. To buy it – the token you want to snipe does not have to be approved. It does not approve the token for you, but when you go and sell it after 5-10 minutes, you will have the option to approve it for sale via PancakeSwap or Uniswap.
                       
                       </p>

                       <p class="testimony__verifiation"><h4>How can i know you wont scam me?</h4></p>
                    
                    
                       It is not my intention to scam anybody. Once the payment clears, you will receive 2 files – the bot script and a PDF instruction manual. I am mainly a coder and do this for passive income. I am also leaving the comment and review sections open so you can see the feedback. The code is also 100% open based so you can see how it works.
                        Approving a token is only needed when selling it. To buy it – the token you want to snipe does not have to be approved. It does not approve the token for you, but when you go and sell it after 5-10 minutes, you will have the option to approve it for sale via PancakeSwap or Uniswap.

                    <p class="testimony__verifiation"><h4>What about projects using anti-bot, anti-sniper software? Will this still work?</h4></p>
                 
                    About 10% of new tokens / projects use anti-bot software for the listing day.Our bot avoids this software by camouflaging it a normal transaction.We advise not to invest more than 10.000 to avoid being detected. The bot will work perfectly against these and still give you a profit¡
                    
                    </p>

                </p>

                <p class="testimony__verifiation"><h4>What payment methods do you accept? Can i pay with BNB?</h4></p>
             
                
                I accept any major crypto-currencies, which you can check on checkout page. Almost all checkout fields are optional to keep everybody safe. Yes, BNB is also accepted. If you are having issues with the checkout or would like to send the coins manually, feel free to contact me on telegram.
                
                </p>

                <p class="testimony__verifiation"><h4> How does it connect to the blockchain network?</h4></p>
             
                
                
                 It connects directly to the Binance Smart Chain (Or Ethereum chain if you are using it for Uniswap) via node endpoint – while most bots connects through Pancakeswap APIs. The install instructions will provide info on where to get a free, privately hosted node with no downtime. We are not using the free, public nodes.

                </p>

                <p class="testimony__verifiation"> <h4>I have seen cheaper bots out there. Why is your so expensive and why should i buy it from you?</h4></p>
             
                
                There are no cheaper or better bots right now on the market. There were many cases when someone bought a bot for bargain price and he left with all his money stolen. My bot you will buy uncompilled, which means you can verify every line of the code. If someone offers you a bot without source don`t buy it even for 1$ because you`ll propably loose all your money. The code you will receive from me (which took me around 3 months to complete together with the PDF instructions and website design) will be in raw format.
                The bot is not cheap to keep sniping profitable. You will make your money back with the first snipe. That`s how we can both make money and I`ll have motivation to always upgrade the bot.

                        The bot allows you to buy any newly added token from PancakwSwap and Uniswap in amazing speeds ( up to zero seconds from the time of the listing). It is called “sniping” which can make you a big amount of profit. The bot works by: Connecting to the blockchain network, scanning for all mempool / pending transactions, finding and matching the liquidity add transaction of the token you are trying to snipe and then placing the buy order in the same block (Pro/Plus version)

                         This is a question I get a lot. I am a coder and developing and upgrading this bot takes a lot of time. I don`t know how to find good and profitable projects. If I spend my time researching hundreds of telegram groups, twitters and sites I will not have time to develop the bot. That`s why I`m selling it and that way we both can profit from this market. I will profit doing my job and you`ll profit doing your job. But that does not mean I do not use my tool from time to time on projects i am interested in investing in. Yet i always coordinate my snipes with my clients and would also like to ask the same from you.

                                The code is fully open / raw. It means that you can check it with different text viewers like even NotePad. You will be able to see all the functions, where your wallet info is used and when it is used. That is the only way to gain trust from my clients. The tool is also fully legal to use – you are simply the first or one of the first to invest in a new token.
    
                                </p>

                                    Yes! The tool has been recently updated to allow sniping on PancakeSwap V2. Once Uniswap V3 comes out, a free update will be available via your account panel on this site.

                                        The tool is quite easy to use, but for some that would like assistance on using it and setting it up – very, very detailed PDF instructions are included that start from the very beginning of installing a web browser. Windows 7 or higher is needed. Will also work on all latest MacOs systems.

                                                Yes, a wallet will be needed so the bot has somewhere to send the bought tokens. The instructions that i include does show how to make a brand new MetaMask wallet and how to connect it to the bot. It is very easy to do. Trustwallet will work as well, but MetaMask is highly suggested as it will give you more control over the sniped tokens.

                                                    There are a few sniping bots, but none are currently available for sale online except this one and that`s the only one that is able to snipe tokens on liquidity block (sometimes it`s called frontrunning bot). The chances of a perfect zero second snipe are much higher with this bot. I suggest to start and learn with small, medium size projects for best early profits as those wont have other snipers. If i would have to estimate, there are about 100 active snipers currently around the world.
